## Backstory
I've always been intrigued by learning languages outside of my native tongue of English. As a requirement of the public school system in Virginia, I took Spanish starting in 8th grade. It caught my attention and I was decent at it, so I continued willfully for another 3 years. At that time, I had no idea of the impact it would have on me later in life. If I had it to do over again, I would have put way more effort into it, but seeing as that's not possible, I'm still grateful for the 5 years I put in. This year of travel brought those roots to the surface. 

Continuing with this interest in language, I decided to start learning a little bit of Japanese back in 2013, before my first ever visit to Japan. 

## Japan
I spent a month in Japan this fall, my 5th time being to Japan. The previous trips had been shorter and I had become frustrated with not being able to communicate as well as I would have liked. So going in this time for a month, I knew I had my work cut out for me. I picked up my studies from before with Rosetta Stone and Duolingo to try and reach some level of ability. Of all places I've been in the world, Japan is definitely the place where I needed to know the language the most. English is not common at all.
