I'm currently a Software Engineering Team Lead working at [Qualtrax](http://www.qualtrax.com){:target="_blank"}. This blog will be filled with posts about software engineering philosophies, coding experiences and life adventures. I aim to provide content for large-scale architecture and design along with the major challenges that are faced in the enterprise software world.
