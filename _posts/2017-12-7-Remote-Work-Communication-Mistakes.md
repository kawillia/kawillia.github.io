For teams with remote employees to be successful, communication has to be at the front of everyone's minds, all the time. The cohesion of a team can quickly erode if guidelines for communication are not put into place. I'd like to go over some scenarios I've experienced while working remotely and I'll provide solutions and tips for how to make a team improve their communication.

## #1 - Not documenting conversations in an issue tracking system
You know how it goes. A feature starts with an idea, it morphs into more realistic ideas and plans, and at some point turns into something that engineers can understand and eventually turn into working code. Ideally, the process of how a feature evolves is documented so that everyone can stay up to date with its progress.

When details of conversations amongst non-remote team members are not recorded in an issue tracking system, we have left it up to ourselves to remember the details of that conversation. At the same time, we have excluded remote employees from being able to contribute. It's frustrating as a remote employee to later find out that decisions have been made and the details of those decisions are nowhere to be found.

**Resolution** 

Make it a requirement for your team that conversations concerning tasks must be documented in your issue tracking system. Also, be sure to contact remote employees to invite them to the ad hoc conversations.

## #2 - Not providing all team members with proper equipment and licenses
Have you ever joined a video call and you couldn't see or hear your teammates? I didn't think so. Neither have I.

Kidding. This happens all the time. What I've noticed though is it's partially due to all team members not having proper equipment or licenses for software. 

**Resolution**

Let's stop cutting corners on this. The labor cost we would save by not wasting extremely valuable time getting technology to cooperate will more than pay for proper microphones, headsets, premium licenses, etc.

## #3 - Making team members in different time zones sync 100% with headquarters
Alright, so we've hired a remote employee in Los Angeles but headquarters is on the east coast. Or, let's say we have a current employee who has now gone remote and they are working from Buenos Aires. In one case, we have an employee who is 3 hours behind the "normal schedule" and in the latter case we have an employee who is 2 hours ahead of the "normal schedule". 

By asking those employees to stay 100% in sync with eastern time, you are asking them to do things that you aren't asking employees at headquarters to do. You are immediately making them sacrifice for being remote. Something I've heard before as a justification for this is that working remotely "is a benefit". Does that mean that employees who work in the office are worse off? If that's true, why do employees go into the office at all? Wouldn't we want all employees to have that extra "benefit"?

If you aren't ok with remote employees working on the schedule that works for their time zone, don't hire them. You'll save yourself from potentially alienating employees or making them feel like their position is 2nd tier to those who work at headquarters. That's not a great place to start for a new employee.

**Resolution** 

Find all of the meetings where you want employees to come together. Maybe it's a stand-up, retro, etc. Find a time that works across all time zones where employees are located. For the example I described above, this would mean that you probably would move your stand-up from 9 AM EST to 2 PM EST so that the employee on the west coast has the meeting at 11 AM and the employee in Buenos Aires has the meeting at 4 PM.

**Slight Tangent**

What the heck is a "normal schedule" anyways? Why are we limiting extremely intelligent and skilled employees to only work between a certain set of hours? What if Sebastian normally gets in a groove later in the day or at nights? Wouldn't we want him to work then? Maybe Angela loves waking up at 5 AM so she can get a few hours of work in before heading to the gym and to play tennis. Then, she finishes up later in the afternoon. Don't we want to promote her good health and happiness?

More than a handful of companies have proven that you can be extremely successful working asynchronously or at different times during the day. Embrace communication and let go of the feeling that everything has to be done "NOW!" and you'll be more productive and employee satisfaction will go through the roof.

## #4 - Not having proper screen space for remote employees
When having video calls, don't leave the size of the video stream per remote employee to be tiny. You are missing out on an easy way to make employees feel more connected. A remote employee needs to be able to captivate others in the room as if they were there in person. That's hard to do when they can barely be seen on a screen.

**Resolution**

Buy another TV or monitor that is dedicated to your lovely remote employees' faces. Make them lifesize. And let them know that they are lifesize. It will have a good effect on how they know they are being viewed by people in the office.

## #5 - Not requiring that remote employees turn on video
There are exceptions to this, of course. But, unless the circumstances call for it, remote employees should not leave video turned off while on calls. Visual cues are so important when communicating across a team. Your ability to understand how someone feels about a comment, suggestion or idea is negatively impacted when you cannot see them.

**Resolution**

Hold each other accountable. If someone joins a call and has their video turned off, ask them to turn it on. Over time, it will become natural to be prepared to have your video on and will start to feel strange if someone joins without it.
