For teams with remote employees to be successful, communication has to be at the front of everyone's minds, all the time. The cohesion of a team can quickly erode if guidelines for communication are not put into place. I'd like to go over some scenarios I've experienced while working remotely and I'll provide solutions and tips for how to make a team improve their communication.

## #1 - Not documenting conversations in an issue tracking system
You know how it goes. A feature starts with an idea, it morphs into more realistic ideas and plans, and at some point turns into something that engineers can understand and eventually turn into working code. Ideally, the process of how a feature went from nothing to something is documented somewhere so that everyone can stay up to date with its progress.

A major hinderance to this is when details of conversations amongst non-remote team members are not recorded in the issue tracking system. By doing this, not only have we left it up to ourselves to remember the details of that conversation but we've completely left out remote employees from the conversation at all. There's nothing more frustrating as a remote employee than later finding out that decisions have been made about something and the details of those decisions are nowhere to be found.

**Resolution** 

Make it a requirement on your team that conversations concerning features or defects must be documented in your issue tracking system. Be sure to contact remote employees to invite them to the ad hoc conversation.

## #2 - Not providing all team members with proper equipment
Have you ever joined a video call and you couldn't see or hear your teammates? I didn't think so. I haven't either. 

Kidding. This happens all the time. What I've noticed though is it's partially due to all team members not having proper equipment and licenses for software. Maybe one day someone will fire up the video call and everything will work smoothly. The next day, someone else starts up the call and suddenly we have no audio. 

Let's stop cutting corners on this. The labor cost we would save by not wasting extremely valuable time getting technology on our side for these calls will more than pay for proper microphones, headsets, premium licenses, etc. required to have a great experience.

## #3 - Making team members in different time zones sync 100% with headquarters
Alright, so we've hired a remote employee in Los Angeles but headquarters is on the east coast. Or, let's say we have a current employee who has now gone remote and they are working from Buenos Aires. In one case, we have an employee who is 3 hours behind the "normal schedule" and in the latter case we have an employee who is 2 hours ahead of the "normal schedule". 

By asking those employees to stay 100% in sync with eastern time, you are asking them to do things that you aren't asking employees at headquarters to do. You are immediately making them pay for being remote. Something I've heard before as a justification for this is that working remote "is a benefit". So are you saying that employees who work in the office are worse off? If that's true, why do you have an office? Wouldn't you want all employees to have that extra "benefit"?

If you aren't ok with remote employees working on the schedule that works for their time zone, don't hire them. You'll save yourself from potentially alienating employees or making them feel like their position is 2nd tier to those who go into the office. That's not a great place to start for a new employee.

**Resolution** 

Find all of the meetings where you want employees to come together. Maybe it's a stand-up, retro, etc. Find a time that works across all time zones. For the example I described above, this would mean that you probably would move your stand-up from 9 AM EST to 2 PM EST so that the employee on the west coast has the meeting at 11 AM and the employee in Buenos Aires has the meeting at 4 PM.

**Slight Tangent**

What the heck is a "normal schedule" anyways? Are we really still boxing in extremely intelligent and skilled employees to only working between a certain set of hours? What if Sebastian normally gets in a groove later in the day or at nights? Wouldn't we want him to work then? Maybe Angela loves waking up at 5 AM so she can get a few hours of work in before heading to the gym and to play tennis. Then, she finishes up later in the afternoon. Don't we want to promote her good health and happiness?

More than a handful of companies have proven that you can be extremely successful working asynchronously or at different times during the day. Embrace communication and let go of the feeling that everything has to be done "NOW!" and you'll be more productive and employee satisfaction will go through the roof.

## #4 - Not having proper screen space for remote employees
A concern I often hear with remote work is that remote employees feel disconnected. That's a valid concern and there are ways to address it. For the sake of this item, I want to flip it around and say that I want to make employees in the office feel more connected to remote employees.

When having video calls, don't leave the size of the video stream per remote employee to be a tiny. You are missing out on an easy way to make employees feel more connected. A remote employee needs to be able to captivate others in the room as if they were there in person. That's hard to do when they can barely be seen on screen.

**Resolution**

Buy another TV, monitor, etc. that is dedicated to your lovely remote employees' faces. Make them lifesize. And let them know that they are lifesize. It will have a good effect on how they know they are being viewed by their fellow employees in the office.

## #5 - Not requiring that remote employees turn on video
There are exceptions to this, of course. But, unless the circumstances call for it, remote employees should not leave video turned off while on calls. Visual cues are so important when communicating across a team. Your ability to understand how someone feels about a comment, suggestion or idea is negatively impacted when you cannot see them.

**Resolution**

Hold each other accountable. If someone joins a call and has their video turned off, prompt them to turn it on. Over time, it will become natural to be prepared to have your video on. It will start to be strange if someone joins without it.
