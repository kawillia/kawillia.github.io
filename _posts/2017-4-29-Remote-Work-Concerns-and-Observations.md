There is still a lot of debate over whether or not employees who work remotely can be as productive as employees in the office. I want to walk through some common concerns I've heard and address them with observations of my own while working remotely. This post is from the perspective of a software engineer and team lead/manager for software engineers.

## Concern #1 - Distractions/Interruptions
*"Aren't you distracted working in a coffee shop or a coworking space or [put any random place here]?"*

The short answer is "no", but let's explore why.

So how about in-office distractions? Have you been interrupted for a question that could have been sent over Slack or email? At that time, were you in such a groove that an interruption cost you 15-30 minutes to get spun back up? Were you wearing headphones or earbuds to signal that you would prefer to not be interrupted, and yet, it happened? How about the conversation about work that's happening across the room that you can hear just well enough to get interested in it? Next thing you know, you are invested in that conversation instead of what you were working on.

These are all common distractions that being in the office will produce. Yes, they *can* occur while working remotely, but typically, since you are not working alongside coworkers, the people around you are less prone to interrupting you. They have fewer reasons to do so. And while side conversations do happen throughout the day when working remotely, typically they are not about work. Many times we continue talking about work while on break or at lunch simply because we can and it's what we all have in common. Working remotely doesn't allow this situation to occur. Perhaps you will find yourself in a wildly entertaining and insightful conversation about technology, but generally, it's not specific to your company or your job. You get the mental break that you desire and that is necessary to perform at your peak.

Through my experience, we tend to write off these distractions in the office because of the benefits of building relationships and collaboration. Yes, building relationships with coworkers can be more difficult when you are not around every day. But, I will say that casual conversations with coworkers on [take your pick of video chat app] are extremely helpful and sometimes even more effective. I've noticed that you catch up on more about what's going on in people's lives as opposed to the calls being strictly about work.

The topic of collaboration is one I will write about in a future post that deals with collaboration overload. What I will say for now is that with technology as it exists today, there is no reason for a lack of collaboration. Yes, it may take a little extra work if you and your coworkers have gotten used to physically being around each other every day, but it doesn't mean it's not possible or even as successful.

This year, I spent 10 weeks with [Hacker Paradise](http://www.hackerparadise.org "Hacker Paradise"){:target="_blank"} in Argentina and Peru. I noticed a dramatic decrease in the number of interruptions throughout the days. I found myself sliding into multiple-hour stints of work, all while not needing to be confined to my apartment. I was still able to be contacted via Slack and email when needed and managing those notifications properly allowed me to ignore the noise until I reached a nice stopping place with my work.

## Concern #2 - Schedule
*"How do remote workers set a defined schedule if they aren't required to be in the office when everyone else is?"*

OK, this one can be tricky for some people. Working remotely does take serious focus and responsibility. What has worked for me is still having a routine. While in Argentina, I woke up at roughly the same time, I went to the gym, I walked to a cafe for breakfast and I got to the coworking space at around the same time every day. This routine helped me stay focused on the fact that I was still working daily and I still had responsibilities that needed to be taken care of.

While this routine helped me get to the coworking space around 11 AM, which was 9 AM EST, I do not believe that we need to concern ourselves so much with having people work the same schedules. Yes, of course, some departments like a Support team could have problems working under modified hours because the time in which they need to be available to the customer could be static. Generally speaking though, if you are not working in a real-time environment, let go of the idea that everyone needs to work at the same time. Is it really that big of a deal for an engineer to work from 11-7 instead of 9-5?  What if that employee feels sharper and has major creative breakthroughs later in the day? Wouldn't you want them to work a different schedule to get the most out of their day? Over a longer period of time, wouldn't that provide much more value to both the employee and the employer? 

What problems do different schedules cause? Perhaps an employee would start to miss morning stand up because it's been at the same time for years. OK, that's an easy fix. Are we concerned that a two-hour gap between a response to a question from the engineer who hasn't started working yet is going to cause delays or blocks? If that's the case, I would be curious about why. Do you have an architect who makes every decision instead of empowering all engineers to make decisions? Do you have knowledge silos that are causing a lack of understanding amongst all engineers? There might be something deeper going on than what appears on the surface.

__Let's get employees working on what they love when they love.__

## Concern #3 - Productivity
*"How do I know remote employees are working?"*

Do you trust your employees? No? OK, that's not good.

Great, so we trust our employees. Why do we let that creeping feeling of wondering whether or not someone at home or at the coffee shop is "actually working?" We trust them, right? Does it make us feel better that we can see them? Does it not matter that perhaps in the office, they are bored of being in the same environment every day and that their mind starts to wander? What if that takes them to a state of watching YouTube videos for hours on end or swiping through Facebook only to look at more pictures of poorly lit dinner photos? Is it ok because we can see them? Or even worse, do we think that if we walk by them enough times throughout the day, they will feel like they need to always have work-related windows open on their computer.

Every employee wants to be trusted. Give them that respect and simply ask for them to show off what they've been working on. If we do run into productivity problems, just as if we sat right next to them everyday, mentor them through it. Start pairing sessions with [take your pick of screen sharing app] and have them work through the problem they are facing. The mutual respect and trust will build on both ends.

## Closing Observation - Do we simply just feel uncomfortable with it?
What if I proposed that the idea of remote work makes us feel this way just because it is different? What if companies had started fully remote from the beginning? Would we feel strange about coming into an office and being in that environment? I'd venture to say that's probably true. 

As with pretty much everything, change is hard and takes time. But, let's continue to consider these questions before coming to a judgment about why remote work is bad or difficult. In a future post, I will write about my time with Hacker Paradise and the enormous benefits I experienced while working remotely.
