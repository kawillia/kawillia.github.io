title: Trust Your Employees Who Work Remote
---

There is still a lot of debating whether or not employees who work remote can be as productive because they "have too many distractions." 
I want to, for a minute, consider the distractions that are omnipresent in many offices. Please consider that my viewpoint here is 
strictly for job responsiblities that are not inhibited by remote work. 

How many times has a co-worker walked up to your desk and interrupted you to ask a question that could have been sent over Slack or Email? Were you even wearing headphones or earbuds to signal that you 
would prefer to not be bothered, and yet, you were still interrupted? Now, don't me wrong, I am all for communicating as a team and interacting daily 
with you co-workers. But, again, I'm simply identifying distractions that do occur. How about
those 15+ minute conversations about absolutely nothing that you have while refilling your water in the kitchen? Or even the occasional
hour and a half lunch at Bdubs that almost always ends with you wanting to be asleep by 3:00? Right?

I mention these to make us consider further **why** letting employees work remote makes us **feel** uneasy. What if I proposed
that it makes us feel this way because it is simply different? What if companies had started fully remote from the beginning? Would
we feel strange about coming into an office and being around co-workers? I'd venture to say that's probably true. What I hope is that
we can get over that hump and find that we should let employees work wherever and however it is that they feel most comfortable and
productive. That's when both the employee and the company get the most benefit. Let's stop kidding ourselves that employees need
to be in a chair by 8 or 9 in the morning and leave by 5 or 6. What if that employee has major creative breakthroughs later in the
day? Wouldn't you want them to work a different schedule to get the most out of their day?
