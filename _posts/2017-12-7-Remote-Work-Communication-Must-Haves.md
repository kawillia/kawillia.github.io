For teams with remote employees to be successful, communication has to be at the front of everyone's minds, all the time. The cohesion of a team can quick erode if guidelines for communication are not put into place. I'd like to go over some scenarios I've experienced while working remotely and I'll provide solutions and tips for how to make a team improve their communication.

## #1 - Not documenting conversations in an issue tracking system
My recent personal experience had me using GitHub as our issue tracking system, so for the purposes of this blog, we'll assume we are using GitHub. You know how it goes. A feature starts with an idea, it morphs into more realistic ideas and plans, and at some point turns into something that developers can understand and eventually turn into working code. Ideally, the process of how a feature went from nothing to something is documented somewhere. This makes it easier for all team members to stay up to date with other features that the team is working on, or when the features makes it way to them for code review, testing or any other reason, the doubt of what is happening with the feature is gone.

A major hinderance to this is when outcomes of conversations amongst non-remote team members are not recorded in the issue tracking system. By doing this, not only have we left it up to ourselves to remember the details of that conversation but we've completely left out remote employees from the conversation at all! 

There's nothing more frustrating as a remote employee than later finding out that decisions have been made about something but the details of those decisions are nowhere to be found.

## #2 - Not providing all team members with proper equipment

## #3 - Making team members in different time zones sync 100% with headquarters

## #4 -
